Data Modeling from, or design models based on, existing data models that satisfy your application's data access patterns. 
  # DB DESIGN
  -- access patterns that are required by the operations and business support systems (OSS/BSS)  <br>

  ```
  NOTE 
  To reduce query complexity and scale efficiently use composite key aggregation & denormalization with design patterns like:
  - adjacency list pattern
  - overloaded global secondary indexes
  - partitioned tables/indexes
  - global secondary index write sharding,
  - global secondary index overloading, 
  - composite keys, composite sort keys
  - materialized aggregations
NoSQL Workbench for DynamoDB, you can build new data models from, or design models based on, existing data models that satisfy your application's data access patterns.
